Stable tag: .3

Integrates with Paid Memberships Pro to limit the number of times non-members can view posts on your site.

== Description ==

Inspired by sites like the New York Times, which limits users to 5-10 monthly article views before redirecting users to a paywall. The plugin sets a cookie for each visitor to track their views per month. This means that (just like the NYTimes sites) it is incredibly easy to circumvent this protection by using a different computer, browsers, or incognito mode, etc. The idea is not to completely block users from your site, but to gently nudge returning readers to sign up for an account.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have the Paid Memberships Pro plugin installed and activated.
1. Upload the `pmpro-limit-post-views` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Configure settings on the Limit Post Views settings page.
1. Make sure your PMPro levels page mentions the post viewing limit so users know why they are being redirected.
